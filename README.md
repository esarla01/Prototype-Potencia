# Tutor Matching Platform (Demo Version) - Non-Profit Project

This project is a demo version of a tutor matching platform created to support individuals from immigrant backgrounds. Built by a diverse team of 14 students at Tufts University, the platform was designed using **React**, **MongoDB**, and **Express**.

The project spanned a year, with our team learning and contributing to web technologies along the way. The final code has been anonymized for display purposes, and important components have been excluded as the demo version. 

Feel free to explore how we worked together to create a valuable tool for the community!

### Key Features:
- React-based front-end and back-end.
- MongoDB database for seamless data storage.
- Designed with inclusivity and accessibility in mind.

This is just the tip of the icebergâ€”excited to share what we built! ðŸš€
